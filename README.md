# FakeBank
An interactive script that can be used to string along scammers.

You can view a demonstration of how I used this when I created it along with a video of it in action on my blog post here:

Most of it is written to manually produce specific results no matter what you type because I didn't want to take time to write out actual options that affected the outcome. Some day I may build it out more if I engage more scammers regularly or if someone wants to contribute to it.Â
